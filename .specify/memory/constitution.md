# Poly-Scanner Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. TypeScript Strict Mode
All code must be written in TypeScript with strict mode enabled to ensure code quality and catch potential errors early.

### II. Linting
Code must be linted using ESLint and formatted with Prettier to maintain a consistent code style.

### III. Unit Testing
All code must have unit tests written using Vitest with a minimum of 80% code coverage to ensure reliability.

### IV. CLI Outputs
CLI outputs must be clear, consistent, and readable to provide a good user experience.

### V. Optimized Data Fetching
Data fetching and simulation logic must be optimized for efficiency to ensure performance.

## Governance

All pull requests and reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Any deviation must be justified and documented.
